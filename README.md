# Operator Harness

A personal **operator harness** — a Claude-Code-driven operating system for knowledge work, built on top of an Obsidian vault. It turns Claude Code into a persistent "chief of staff": a rule layer, a skill library, autonomous routines, multi-channel remote control (Discord / Feishu), and a learning loop that promotes recurring corrections into machine-enforceable rules.

This repository is a **sanitized, portable snapshot** of that system — everything needed to re-bootstrap it on a fresh PC, with all secrets and personal content removed. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for exactly what was scrubbed.

> **Status:** machinery only. Personal vault *content* (notes, projects, identity, contacts, incident history) is **not** included — only the framework, scripts, skills, rules, hooks, and the scaffolding to run them. The 3-pillar workspace folders (`00 Raw` … `10 Action`) ship as **empty scaffolding**: a role-README per folder plus self-updating dashboards, so the structure is there to drop your own content into. Identity files (`me.md`, `MEMORY.md`) ship as fill-in templates.

## Architecture in one paragraph

Claude Code runs with a set of **lifecycle hooks** (`SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `Stop` / `PostToolUse` / `SessionEnd`) that inject the vault's memory at startup, probe which remote channels are live, drain a signal queue, mirror replies to Feishu, and log usage + judgment events. The **vault** holds the rule layer (`09 Rules/*`), a library of **skills** (each a `SKILL.md` + optional scripts), and **autonomous routines** scheduled via Windows Task Scheduler. Remote control comes from **daemons** (an AFK Discord/Feishu bridge + a Feishu event consumer) that let you drive Claude Code from your phone. A **judgment loop** captures corrections and distills them into new rules over time. The `.harness/` adapter abstracts machine-specific paths so the same `master` runs on Windows and macOS.

## Quick start

> **Prerequisites:** [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), Python 3.12+, Node 18+, Obsidian.
> **Windows:** PowerShell 5.1+ + Task Scheduler (use `install/bootstrap.ps1`).
> **macOS:** launchd + `python3` (use `install/bootstrap.sh`; see [`macos/README.md`](macos/README.md) for the port — full parity minus WeChat ingest).

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<you>/operator-harness.git
cd operator-harness
# 1. copy & edit the config (vault location, etc.)
copy install\config.example.json install\config.json
notepad install\config.json
# 2. run the installer (substitutes machine paths, copies vault + ~/.claude, optionally registers tasks)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install\bootstrap.ps1 -ConfigPath install\config.json
```

Then **personalize**: fill in `vault/me.md`, `vault/CLAUDE.md`, `vault/MEMORY.md`, and configure your own channel tokens (see [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md)).

Full step-by-step: **[`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md)** · what was removed and the placeholder legend: **[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)**.
